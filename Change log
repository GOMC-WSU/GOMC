##[1.00] - 12/4/2015
+ Added Examples of water and DME for NVT and GCMC
+ Added bin/linux, which contains all executable files for linux

##[1.00] Ewald branch - 12/8/2015
+ Improve the initialization of Ewald's parameters, so that non-ewald simulation can also run on ewald code without crashing.
+ CMakeList.txt file is added.

##[1.00] - 12/22/2015
+ Update CPUSide.cpp, move hist into the ifdef of GCMC. Target at the floating operation issue returned by NVT and GEMC simulations.

##[1.00] - 01/25/2016
+ Fix the coherence issue on two boxes simulations, including NPT, GEMC, and two boxes GCMC simulations.

+ To fix the issue, Calp() and SetupRecip() have to be recalculated everytime before and after the volume transfer; RecipSinSum and RecipCosSum arrays have to be synchronized in two boxes simulations; GEMC_NVT is different from GEMC_NPT, the difference between GEMC_NVT and GEMC_NPT requires "if" statement.

? GEMC is returning good result from computation; however, it does not return correct results. A potential bug inside of the computation logic.

##[1.00] - -3/15/2016
+ Fix the bug of GEMC simulation. Now all NVT, GCMC, and GEMC are working.
+ Enable the Cache version of GEMC to save time; however, the scalability is limited.

##[1.6] - 04/01/2016
+ IntraSwap is added into the code.
+ Blockoutput, fluctoutput are modified to print out ewald energies.
+ Tests of this modification are not done yet.
