# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.1] - 9/4/2017
+ Adsorption
+ Fixed the bug where GPU and CPU total energy calculations where slighty different.
+ Removed some unused variables
+ Removed some warnings
+ Fixed pow function ambiguity in some compilers like clang
+ Fixed compiling bug for Clock.h when using clang (mac users)
+ Set a maximum of 9999999999 for output energies

## [2.0] - 6/11/2017
+ NPT added
+ GPU implementation has been added to the project

## [1.9] - 12/12/2016
+ Revision on output. We now only generate one output file.
+ Bug fixes
+ Printing some hardware information
+ Changes to example files which can be found at GOMC_Examples repository

## [1.8] - 10/12/2016
+ Parallelizing CBMC branched algorithm using OpenMP
+ Bug Fixes

## [1.7] - 04/21/2016
+ Fix the bug of free Ewald class, which returns memory segmentation fault if ewald is not activated.
TO DO: IntraSwap does not work properly. The bug is going to be fixed.


##[1.6] - 04/01/2016
+ IntraSwap is added into the code.
+ Blockoutput, fluctoutput are modified to print out ewald energies.
+ Tests of this modification are not done yet.

## [1.7] - 03/24/2016
+ I/O fixes

## [1.6] - 03/24/2016
+ Code cleaning

## [1.5] - 03/24/2016
+ Support for Ewald Summation

##[1.00] - 3/15/2016
+ Fix the bug of GEMC simulation. Now all NVT, GCMC, and GEMC are working.
+ Enable the Cache version of GEMC to save time; however, the scalability is limited.

##[1.00] - 01/25/2016
+ Fix the coherence issue on two boxes simulations, including NPT, GEMC, and two boxes GCMC simulations.

+ To fix the issue, Calp() and SetupRecip() have to be recalculated everytime before and after the volume transfer; RecipSinSum and RecipCosSum arrays have to be synchronized in two boxes simulations; GEMC_NVT is different from GEMC_NPT, the difference between GEMC_NVT and GEMC_NPT requires "if" statement.

? GEMC is returning good result from computation; however, it does not return correct results. A potential bug inside of the computation logic.

## [1.1] - 01/20/2016
+ Supporting Martini forcefield

##[1.00] - 12/22/2015
+ Update CPUSide.cpp, move hist into the ifdef of GCMC. Target at the floating operation issue returned by NVT and GEMC simulations.

##[1.00] Ewald branch - 12/8/2015
+ Improve the initialization of Ewald's parameters, so that non-ewald simulation can also run on ewald code without crashing.
+ CMakeList.txt file is added.

##[1.00] - 12/4/2015
+ Added Examples of water and DME for NVT and GCMC
+ Added bin/linux, which contains all executable files for linux

## [1.0] - 10/18/2015
+ Changes for input file system.
+ Added Cell list optimization to the GPU and the Serial code.

## [0.972] - 5/11/2015
+ Fixes for PDB output for NVT in the GPU code.

## [0.971] - 5/6/2015
+ Added missing CMAKE files for GOMC serial.
+ Updates to the test systems to be compatible with the new input formats.

## [0.97] - 4/11/2015

+ Added support for grand canonical ensemble.
+ Fixed calculation of angular weights for branched molecules coupled-decoupled configuration bias algorithm.
+ Improved move adjustments for better targeting of desired acceptance rate.
+ Various minor bug fixes for fringe conditions.
+ Improvements to I/O handling, inclusion of new output types relating to grand canonical ensemble (fluctuations, energy/particle samples, and distribution of molecule counts).
